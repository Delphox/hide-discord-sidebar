# Hide Discord Sidebar

Hide Discord Sidebar is a Chrome extension for Discord users who find the Discord sidebar too huge and wish to minimize/hide it when they are not using it. This extension minimizes the channels list into a small left sidebar when it is not in use as well as installs a button on the top right corner that hides/shows the Discord server list.

IMPORTANT: This extension is only meant to work on Discord in Chromium based browsers. Tested and working on Windows, Mac and Linux versions of Brave Browser and Chrome.
